# Weird docker-email-autodiscover

This service is used for images that need basic ldap functionallity but with the postfix-book schema compatible with the old mailAccound objectClass.
The image is compatible with for example the [tvial/docker-mailserver](https://hub.docker.com/r/tvial/docker-mailserver/)
